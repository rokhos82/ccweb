    <subheader>Converse County Launches an Unprecedented Platform</subheader>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Converse County is bringing financial transparency to its citizens, launching a web site where they can browse the county's finances on-line with up-to-date financial information.  The county has partnered with OpenGov to bring the citizens of Converse County the capability of reviewing all monies that are collected or disbursed by the county government.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Citizens and staff will be able to do a comparison over an eight-year span of revenue and expenditures using customizable graphs and bar charts.  It can be as basic as finding out what the county's total revenue is, or as intricate as finding out what each specific department spends on office supplies.</p>

            Converse County has numerous boards where citizens can serve to make a difference in our County.  In June 2014, the Hospital, Library and Parks &amp; Rec Boards have terms expiring. In addition, the County has openings on other boards where the terms expire throughout the year.  These boards include:  Planning and Zoning, Airport, Natural Resource Planning and Tourism.<br /><br />

            Typically board members focus on a direction the board will take that affects the future of the County, as well as a commitment to the residents to meet a variety of purposes, including recreation.<br /><br />
