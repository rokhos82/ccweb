            Converse County has numerous boards where citizens can serve to make a difference in our County.  In June 2014, the Hospital, Library and Parks &amp; Rec Boards have terms expiring. In addition, the County has openings on other boards where the terms expire throughout the year.  These boards include:  Planning and Zoning, Airport, Natural Resource Planning and Tourism.<br /><br />

            Typically board members focus on a direction the board will take that affects the future of the County, as well as a commitment to the residents to meet a variety of purposes, including recreation.<br /><br />
