            Converse County has numerous boards where citizens can serve to make a difference in our County.  In June 2014, the Hospital, Library and Parks &amp; Rec Boards have terms expiring. In addition, the County has openings on other boards where the terms expire throughout the year.  These boards include:  Planning and Zoning, Airport, Natural Resource Planning and Tourism.<br /><br />

            Typically board members focus on a direction the board will take that affects the future of the County, as well as a commitment to the residents to meet a variety of purposes, including recreation.<br /><br />

					 This January of 2014, the Converse County Treasurer's Office is releasing what we hope to be an annual publication: a Report to the Citizens of Converse County.  The report contains statistical and financial data about the county, as well as general information about all of the assets that make the county great.
