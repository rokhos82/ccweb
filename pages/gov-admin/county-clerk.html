<p>Hi! Welcome to our web page. Our intent, in providing this information,
  is to cover the most frequently asked questions as they pertain
  to the duties of this office.</p>

<p>As you look through the various topics, should you not find the
  answer, please feel free to get in touch by using our <br>
  e-mail address or any of the other contact information. Also, should
  you have suggestions on how we can improve upon any of the services
  we offer, we would love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Even though I have staff members assigned to specific topics,
  any one of my staff will be able to assist with your requests.</p>
<p><strong>Clerk to the Board of Commissioners</strong></p>

<p>The County Clerk serves as secretary to the Board of Commissioners of Converse County.
The Clerk prepares agendas and distributes the minutes from all meetings held by
the Commissioners. Anyone wishing to be on the agenda should call for an appointment.
The appointments are in half hour increments unless requests are made for a longer
timeframe. Agendas are updated up to 12:00 p.m. on the Monday immediately preceding
the regular session.</p>

<p>The Commissioners meet in regular session on the first Tuesday
and the following Wednesday of each month, as well as on the third Tuesday.
All meetings are held in the Commissioners Chambers in the Courthouse and begin at 8:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Generally, there are about three years of Commission minutes posted on
the website.  Anyone wishing a copy of the minutes that are not posted
on the website can make a request to the County Clerk.</p>

<p>The Clerk also administers the applications and maintains the records
for the various liquor licenses and/or malt beverage permits in Converse County.</p>

<p><strong>Budgets, Accounting and Personnel</strong></p>
<p>The County Clerk serves as the Chief Budget Officer for the County,
  and staff members assist in tasks related to accounting, payroll,
  fixed assets, and accounts receivable (for those accounts not covered
  by the County Treasurer). All tasks are done in accordance with
  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (WSS 16-4-120(c)).</p>
<p>Prior year's budgets are available in detail or by summary. Persons
wishing copies must pay $1.00 per page.</p>
