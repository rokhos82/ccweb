                <p><b>Identification of Businesses: </b>Commercial
                    and industrial operations are identified through various means
                    such as sales tax lists, telephone books, advertisements, observations
                    or word of mouth. New businesses are added to a historical listing
                    of businesses in the Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA)
                    sub-system developed by the state. The information contained
                    in this file is used to generate letters and forms sent to the
                    businesses each year requesting updated reports/renditions of
                    personal property. The timetable for the mailing of the forms
                    is in late November of each year and they must be completed and
                  returned by the following <b>March 1st.</b></p>

                    tangible personal property used in a business is taxable and
                    must be listed. This will include (but not limited to) all furniture,
                    fixtures, machines, computers, software, equipment, telephone
                    systems, tools, manuals or libraries, unlicensed vehicles, mobile
                    machinery, along with any small items used in a business. Leasehold
                    improvements must be reported, but listed separately and clearly
                    identified. Leased equipment must be listed in detail along with
                    the name and address of the lease company. Inventory held for
                  resale and licensed vehicles should not be reported.</p>

                <p><b>Information Needed:</b> To ensure that a proper
                    value is placed on each item of personal property, it is in the
                    interest of the owner to list as much information as possible.
                    The forms provided have columns for Description, Make, Model,
                    Year Built, Serial Number, Installed Cost, Date Acquired and
                    New/Used. If you paid separately for freight, installation, taxes
                    or other fees, the cost must be either added to the item or listed
                    separately and identified. The three most important columns are
                    the Description, Installed Cost and Date Acquired. These will
                    establish the category, trending and depreciation tables used
                  in arriving at a value for tax purposes.</p>
