                                      One of the first and more important areas of consideration
                                      are properties within a geographic neighborhood
                              and their relative sales ratios. This is because the neighborhoods
                                      have been developed on Location, Economic Forces,
                              Governmental
                                      and Social Factors and Boundaries that group properties

                              that

              <p><strong>YOUR TURN</strong> </p>
              <ul>
                <li>                  During the months of April of each year Assessment Schedules
                          are mailed to each property owner listing the estimated Market
                          Value and Assessment. In addition beginning with the 1996
                          schedule, the previous year's tax and estimated tax for the
                          current year will be listed using the previous year's Mill
                          Levy. The previous year's information will not be listed
                          on properties that have had changes in legal description
                          or if they did not exist in the previous year (i.e., newly
                          platted). Property owners have the right to appeal the values
                          placed on their property; however, the appeal <i><b>MUST</b></i> be
                          filed within <i><b>30</b></i> days of the assessment mail
                          date. Property Record Cards are available for the owner's
                          review to ensure the accuracy of the information used to
                          generate the property's market value. These are available
                          at any time for review. Our goal is to make the estimates
                          of value based on the best information available. Statutes
                          developed and passed during the 1996 legislative session
                          allow for persons appealing their assessments to review the
                          SOCs used in determining the value of their property. This
                          SOC review period is only during the 30-day appeal period
                          and the property owner may not further disclose the sales
                          information to other persons or property owners. The sales
                          information may be introduced and revealed to the County
                          Board of Equalization during a formal appeal, but actions
                must be taken to prevent its indiscriminate disclosure.</li>
