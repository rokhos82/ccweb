              <p>Property assessment and taxation is a complex subject. Knowing
                the terminology will help you understand the assessment process.
                The Converse County Assessor's office is dedicated to educating
                the public about procedures and methods used to be in compliance
                with State of Wyoming statutes, rules, and regulations.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Fair Market Value</em></strong> is the amount of
                money a well-informed buyer would pay and a well-informed seller
                would accept for property that has been on the open market for
                a reasonable amount of time, assuming neither buyer nor seller
                is acting under pressure.</p>
              <p><font class="underlined"><strong><em>Assessed Value</em></strong></font> is
                the taxable value of each property. This value is calculated
                by multiplying the fair market value by the level of assessment.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Level of Assessment</em></strong> is the percentage
                of the fair market value that determines assessed value. The
                current level of assessment for industrial use properties is
                11.5%; all other properties are at 9.5%. The level of assessment
                is set by the legislature and is subject to change.</p>
              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Mill</em></strong></span> literally,
                one thousandth. For tax purposes: $1 of taxes for every $1,000
                of assessed value.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Mill Levy</em></strong> is the number of dollars
                in taxes that a property owner must pay for every $1,000 of assessed
                value. This amount is based on budget requests from various taxing
                entities.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Assessment Date</em></strong> under Wyoming Statute
                is January 1st of each tax year. All properties are valued, assessed
                and taxed to the owner of record on this date.</p>

              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Mass Appraisal</em></strong></span> is
                the process of valuing a universe of properties as of a given
                date, utilizing standard methodology, employing common data,
                and allowing for statistical testing. The goal of mass appraisal
                is the same as fee appraisal: to develop a reasonable estimate
                of fair market value.</p>
              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>CAMA (Computer Assisted
                      Mass Appraisal)</em></strong> </span>is a computer system
                      developed by the State of Wyoming to perform three functions: </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> 1. Warehouse information collected by the assessor's office
                  staff. Information such as ownership, location, size, use,
                  physical characteristics, condition, and sales information
                  must be continually updated.<br />
                  <br />

      2. CAMA is like a complex calculator. It contains equations, cost and depreciation
      tables which automate standard appraisal methods to estimate fair market
      value.<br />
              <br />
      3. Quality control features such as reports generated using various parameters.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <em><strong>Real Property</strong></em> is defined as land
                and improvements (buildings and structures) permanently fixed
                to the land.</p>
              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Personal Property</em></strong></span> includes
                material assets that are not fixed to the land: furniture, machinery
                or equipment, transportable homes.</p>

              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Statement of Consideration</em></strong></span> is
                a document, which provides sales information that must be used
                in addition to other information to determine current market
                value. The seller, buyer, or agent completes the document at
                the time of a property transfer. Information is confidential
                and not public record. Property owners may review the sales information
                used to determine the value of their property. The SOC review
                period is only during the 30-day appeal period and the property
                owner may not further disclose the sales information to other
                persons or property owners. Sales information may be introduced
                to the County Board of Equalization during a formal appeal, but
                actions must be taken to prevent its indiscriminate disclosure.</p>
              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Neighborhood</em></strong></span> boundaries
                are developed by the assessor based on physical, economical,
                governmental, or social factors. These neighborhood boundaries
                are used when sales studies are done. Neighborhood maps are available
                for review in the assessor's office.</p>
              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Tax Districts</em></strong></span> are
                the geographic area on which a taxing entity has the right to
                levy taxes. These entities include school districts, counties,
                cities, water or sewer districts, fire districts or other specially
                formed districts as designated by state statute.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Tax Base</em></strong> is the total value of property
                against which the property tax is levied.</p>

              <p><span class="underlined"><strong><em>Property Tax Appraiser</em></strong></span> is
                the designation given to those persons who have completed the
                education and training mandated by the State of Wyoming for anyone
                making a valuation judgment used as a basis for property taxation.</p>
