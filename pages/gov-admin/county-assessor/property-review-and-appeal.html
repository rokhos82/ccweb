                  is key to a fair system of taxation. My goal is to ensure all
                  taxpayers are aware of their rights and to make the process
                  as efficient and painless as possible.</b></p>

              <p><b><i>Wyoming Statute 39-13-103</i></b> directs that all property
                will be listed, valued and assessed as of <i><b>January 1</b></i> of
                each year. Assessment Schedules must be mailed to all property
                owners on or before the fourth Monday of April. In 2001, Laramie
                County schedules were mailed <b>March 19th</b>. </p>

              <p><b><i>Wyoming Statute 39-13-109(b)(i)</i> </b>requires persons
                wishing to contest their assessment to file not later than 30
                days after the mail date or postmark a statement with the Assessor
                outlining their reason or disagreement with the assessment. The
                Assessor and Protestant must disclose witnesses and exchange
                information, evidence and documents relevant to the appeal no
                later than 15 days prior to the scheduled county board of equalization
                hearing. Hearings are scheduled for mid June.</p>

              <p align="center"><b>~Basics Procedures~</b></p>
              <p align="left">The Assessment Schedules mailed by the Assessor's
                Office contain the legal description of the property, the estimated
                fair market value and the assessed value. When the property owner
                receives the assessment schedule it should be opened immediately
                and reviewed. Particular attention should be paid to the <b>Market
                Value</b>. Does it represent what the property would have been
                worth if sold on January 1, 2001? If the value is within reason
                and no other errors are noted on the assessment schedule, further
                action is not required. However, if you disagree with the value,
                come into the Assessor's Office as soon as possible to initiate
                the review process. For the 2001 assessment period, the last
                day appeals can be made is <b>April 18, 2001</b>. The process
                is divided into Review and Formal Appeal.</p>
              <p align="center"><b>~Review Process~</b></p>

              <p align="left">When the property owner comes into the office,
                the Property Record Card is reviewed and all property characteristics
                information is checked for accuracy. This includes square foot
                size, construction, finished area, out buildings, etc. Any changes
                may affect the final market value. A &quot;Request for Property
                Review Only&quot; form should be completed and signed by the
                property owner. If this form is not completed by the owner/representative,
                the visit will be considered an informal contact and changes
                in the property/assessment will not be initiated.</p>
              <p align="left">During this review, the property owner may provide
                any information they would like to have considered such as appraisals,
                market analysis, special conditions or influences they feel may
                affect the property value.</p>
              <p align="left">The owner must provide an action desired such as
                their estimate of value as of January 1, 2001. Statements of &quot;it's
                too high&quot; or &quot;it's wrong&quot; are vague and not definable.</p>

              <p align="left">For residential properties, Assessor staff will
                review the sales listing for the appropriate neighborhood with
                the owner and explain the basic neighborhood system. If desired
                by the owner, a copy of the sales listing for his neighborhood
                will be provided. NOTE: Under Wyoming Statute 34-1-142, sales
                information is not a &quot;Public Record&quot; and must be kept
                confidential. Persons receiving sales information may not disclose
                it to other individuals. Property owners may disclose this information
                to the County Board of Equalization in conjunction with any hearing.
                Due to the confidentiality of the sales inflammation it cannot
                be mailed, electronically transmitted or given over the telephone.</p>
              <p align="left">Property owners will be provided a copy of the
                review form.</p>
              <p align="left"><b>Upon Completion of the review the property owner
                  will receive by mail:</b></p>
            </div>
            <p>An amended schedule reflection updated market value and estimated
              2001 tax amount.</p>

              <p align="left">If after a review the property owner feels the
                value of his property is incorrect, he may file an official appeal.
                Official Appeal of Assessment forms are available in the Assessor's
                Office. Copies of the form or statement must be filed with the
                Assessor within 30 days of the mail date or postmark date on
                the Assessment Schedule. A copy of the Rules of Practice and
                Procedures for Appeal Before the County Board of Equalization
                Involving Taxation Matters are available for the property owner
                at the Assessor's Office and also at this website. An appeal
                may be withdrawn at anytime by written notification to the Clerk's
