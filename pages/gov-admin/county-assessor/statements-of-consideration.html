                <p align="left"><b>What is a Statement of Consideration?</b></p>
                <p align="left">Wyoming Statue 34-1-142 requires a statement
                  of consideration be completed whenever a deed, contract or
                  other document transferring legal title is recorded. Information
                  such as the date of sale, purchase price, terms of sale, etc.
                  are required. You will probably complete this document at the
                  time of closing.</p>

                <p align="left"><b>I don't want everyone to know what I paid!</b></p>
                <p align="left">Information on the Statement of Consideration
                  is NOT public information and you are protected form random
                  disclosure by provisions and penalties in 34-1-142. Persons
                  appealing their assessment may review the sales information
                  of properties that were used to determine their fair market
                  value. The review period is only during the 30-day appeal period.
                  Property owners may not further disclose the sales information
                  to other persons or property owners. The sales information
                  may be introduced and revealed to the County Board of Equalization
                  during a formal appeal, but further disclosure is prohibited.</p>
                <p align="left"><b>What does the assessor do with the information?</b></p>
                <p align="left">The County Assessor has the complex job of annually
                  determining the fair market value of all the property within
                  the county. To accomplish this, sales information for an area
                  is analyzed to develop adjustments to bring the property to
                  current market value. Through the use of computer programs,
                  information gained from properties that have sold can be used
                  on properties not sold to achieve a fair market value for all
                  properties. Because the sales information is crucial to this
                  analysis, the assessor may need to verify the information with
                  one or more of the parties to the transaction. This may be
                  done by phone, mail or in person.</p>
                <p align="left"><b>If I paid $86,000, why does my assessment
                    schedule say $87,500?</b></p>
                <p align="left">Wyoming statute also states an individual statement
                  of consideration shall now, by itself, be used to adjust the
                  assessed value of any individual property. To ensure that sold
                  properties are being valued using the same procedures as unsold,
                  all valid open market sales within a neighborhood are used.
                  Neighborhood boundaries are developed on location, economic
                  forces, governmental and social factors. Within neighborhoods
                  other considerations may be age, type of construction, etc.</p>

                <p align="left"><b>Are all sales used in the market studies?</b></p>
                <p align="left">No, only sales that are considered valid open
                  market sales are used. Sales involving foreclosures, relatives,
                  gifts, etc. are generally not used.</p>
                <p align="left"><b>I want to pay my fair share. How can I ensure
                    my property value is within reason?</b></p>
                <p align="left">Owner participation is key in the development
                  of accurate values. Property characteristics such as size,
                  construction type, amenities, are collected by field appraisers.
                  Owners are encouraged to review this information to verify
                  its accuracy. Actual sales information is used by the assessor
                  as an indicator of market value. Your assistance in verifying
                  the information is very helpful.</p>
