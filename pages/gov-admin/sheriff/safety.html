<subheader>Winter Safety</subheader>
<p>When traveling in the winter months please be prepared. Here are a few tips to keep in mind.
	<ul>
		<li>Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle at all times.</li>
		<li>Pack warm clothing.</li>
		<li>Tell someone specifically where you are going, and when you will return.</li>
		<li>Bring along extra food and water.</li>
		<li>Bring along your cell phone and charger, but remember in remote Wyoming there are spots where cell phones donâ€™t work.</li>
		<li>If you become stranded or stuck, stay with your vehicle, crack a window so fresh air can come in to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Conserve your fuel.</li>
	</ul>
