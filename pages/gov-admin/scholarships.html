<p style='line-height:normal'><b><u><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>General Information</span></u></b></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Wyoming County Commissioners'
Scholarships are available to students who plan on attending one of the seven
Wyoming Community Colleges or the University of Wyoming.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The scholarships are not specific
to graduating high school students. Non-traditional students are eligible. This
includes graduate students, professional program students and independent
students (those on their own and not supported by parents). There are no deferments,
so the scholarship must be used in the year it is awarded. If the scholarship
is not used in the first semester, the scholarship goes to an alternate.</span></p>

<p style='line-height:normal'><b><u><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman","serif"'>Original Scholarships</span></u></b></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Each County Commission has a
total of three scholarships to award beginning with the fall semester. These
scholarships are $500 per semester ($1,000 for the academic year) and will be
in addition to the Hathaway merit scholarships. The County Commissioners'
scholarships will necessarily reduce the student's need for financial aid,
including need based awards through the Hathaway program.</span></p>

<p style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Criteria for being chosen
includes: GPA, ACT and extra-curricular activities- a failing grade on a math
or English placement exam will be disqualifying.</span></p>

"Times New Roman","serif"'>Renewal Scholarships</span></u></b></p>

<p style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In
addition, each County Commission will have one renewal scholarship. Students
who receive a County Commission scholarship for the first time are eligible to
apply for the renewal scholarship with a value of $500 per semester ($1,000 for
the academic year).</span></p>
