  Never buy a vehicle if the seller cannot show you the title, unless you can
  verify that the title is being held by a lien holder (bank, credit union, etc.).</p>
                  <p align="left">When buying a vehicle, make sure all previous
                    liens have been properly released. Various states have different
                    requirements for releasing liens, so it is a good idea to
                    call our office to find out about the requirements of the
                    state from which the current title was issued.</p>

                  <p align="left">You must be a Wyoming resident to obtain a
                    Wyoming certificate of title, and your physical residence
                    address must be placed on your title. We cannot use a post
                    office box. </p>
                  <p align="left">On Wyoming titles, all sellers must sign in
                    the presence of a notary. Even in cases where there are two
                    names joined by and (example John and Jane Doe), both parties
                    must sign the seller's block on the reverse side of the title
                    and both signatures must be notarized. </p>
                  <p align="left">If the title you receive is from any state
                    other than Wyoming, you must have the vehicle identification
                    number (VIN) inspected by a law enforcement officer (Douglas
                    or Glenrock Police Departments, Converse County Sheriff's
                    Office, Wyoming Highway Patrol). Be prepared to provide proof
                    of ownership (dealer's invoice or bill of sale) and identification. </p>
                  <p align="left">If the vehicle you purchase was manufactured
                    within the past 10 years, you must have a conforming odometer
                    statement and a damage disclosure statement signed by both
                    the seller and the buyer. </p>
                  <p align="left">Licensed Wyoming dealers are authorized to
                    issue a 45-day temporary permit for the vehicles they sell.
                    There is no extension beyond the 45 days. </p>
                  <p align="left">When buying a vehicle from any licensed Wyoming
                    auto dealer, you must be provided with a Wyoming Sales/Use
                    Tax form. This form pertains to the sales tax due to the
                    Treasurer's Office, and a copy must accompany your title
                    work. </p>

                  <p align="left">Wyoming law requires that when an out-of-state
                    title carries a brand it must be placed on the new Wyoming
                    title. In other words, if your out-of-state title has &quot;salvage,&quot; &quot;rebuilt,&quot; &quot;flood,&quot; etc.
                    typed on it, your Wyoming title will also have any such designation
                    on it. </p>
                  <p align="left">Always bring your identification with you when
                    visiting the title office.</p>

                    or to your bank or credit union if the vehicle is financed.</p>
                  <p align="left">In some cases, the dealer or lender may have
                    you sign the application and you need only obtain a copy
                    of the title from the lender or our office, to use when registering

              Quite often, the title you receive from the seller may be one issued from a

              the seller's signatures to be notarized on the title. A good rule of thumb
              is if the title contains a place for a notary, have the seller's signatures
              notarized. You will need the following: </p>

                                        it with the above documents. This is not required if the

                                        be done by the Douglas or Glenrock Police Department, 101

                    When moving to the state of Wyoming, state law requires that you register your
                    vehicle and obtain Wyoming license plates once you are employed in Wyoming.
                    If your out-of-state title is held by a bank, credit union, or other lien holder,
                    you may apply for a non-negotiable title for registration purposes only. This
                  title cannot be used to sell or transfer the vehicle to another party.</p>
                  <p align="left">To apply for a nonnegotiable title, you must
                                      present your current out-of-state registration and identification
                                      at our office. If your out-of-state registration has expired,

                    Duplicate titles can be issued only when the original title has been lost,
                    destroyed, or mutilated. At least one of the current owners of the vehicle
                    must sign an application for duplicate title and have their signatures notarized.
                  The title will be issued following an 11-day waiting period required by law.</p>
