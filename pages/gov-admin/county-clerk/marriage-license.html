<p align="left">Marriage Licenses are  valid (in the State of Wyoming only) for a period of one year from the date of  issue. No blood test is required. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age  to obtain a license without parental consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;  For detailed information on marriage licenses, please read Wyoming State  Statutes 20-1-101 through 20-1-113, which is available on the web.</p>
<p>Applicants under the  age of 16 must have a court order before a license can be issued.</p>
<p>Before you apply for  the license, you and your fianc&eacute;e need to know and provide the following  information:</p>
