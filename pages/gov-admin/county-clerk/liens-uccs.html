  of liens are filed in the Clerk's Office:</p>

<center><b>Lien Forms per Wyoming State Statute, Title 29</b></center>
<p style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:700px;">
These forms are provided to you as a courtesy per language in the WSSs "<i>the lien statement forms shall
be made available and may be obtained at the county clerk’s office of each county</i>".
<br />
<br />

The filing of any lien can have significant legal ramifications to both the claimant and property owner.
Timely and accurate filing of all forms is essential to securing and protecting any lien.  Failure to
abide by legislative requirements related to order, content and deadlines for filing said liens may foreclose
any action against the property owner.  The Converse County Clerk or any deputy thereof, cannot and will not
provide you with any advice or guidance in completion of these forms.  If you have any question or concern
related to the content, order or deadlines mandated to protect your right to payment and/or lien, you should
timely seek the advice of competent legal counsel.
