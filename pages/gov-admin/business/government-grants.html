            <h2 align="left"><strong>How about some help with grant writing?</strong></h2>
            <p align="left">Writing applications for government grants can be
              intimidating enough. Expecting your county government officials
              to explain to constituents how to apply for these grants may be
              even tougher. So <a href="http://www.proposalwriter.com/govtloans.html#debt">www.proposalwriter.com/
              govtloans.html#debt</a> is a good resource guide for explaining
              an often complicated process. Deborah Kluge, a proposal-writing
              expert who offers helpful and easy to understand tips for applying
              for small business loans, local economic development programs,
              government housing loans and many more programs, operates the site.</p>
