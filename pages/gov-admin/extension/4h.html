            <p>4-H is an  informal, practical, learning-by-doing educational program for youth, age 8-18.  The purpose of 4-H is to help youth acquire knowledge, develop life skills, and  form attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, productive  members of society.  Professional and volunteer staff provide educational  projects and activities in animal science, home economics, natural resources,  and handcrafts, as well as leadership and citizenship. Youth are  involved in clubs and can choose from over 50 different project areas. More  information on projects can be found on the <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/4-h/">University of Wyoming 4-H and Youth Website</a>. &nbsp;</p>
