<subheader>Why Prepare for Disaster</subheader>
<p>Disaster can strike without warning, forcing you to go for days without basic necessities or to evacuate your home. Relief workers will be on the scene following a disaster, but may not be able to reach you immediately.</p>
<p>You need to be prepared. Knowing the steps to take during a disaster - weather, flooding, tornadoes, or other crisis - can greatly reduce the danger and distress your family may face. Being prepared can help you stay calm during a crisis and also recover afterward.</p>
<br />
<subheader>Creating a Basic Emergency Plan</subheader>
<p>Having a plan is one of the most important steps you can take in disaster preparedness. Knowing what to do and how to do it can help your family manage disasters with less worry, fear, and uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Check that your insurance policies are up-to-date and provide good coverage.</li>
	<li>Choose a place away from your neighborhood where family members can meet in case you are separated and cannot return home due to a disaster.</li>
	<li>Decide what you and your family would do in each potential emergency situation.</li>
	<li>Draw a floor plan of your home showing escape routes.</li>
	<li>Identify a friend or relative who lives out of the area for family members to contact if you are separated.</li>
	<li>Know how to shut off the water, gas, and electricity at the main switches and valves in your home.</li>
	<li>Plan how to help elderly or disabled neighbors in a disaster.</li>
	<li>Post emergency numbers by every phone and teach children how and when to dial 911.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<subheader>Preparing a Disaster Supply Kit</subheader>
<p>Having a disaster supply kit ready to take with you at a moment's notice ensures that you will have necessary supplies no matter how fast you may need to evacuate. Pack supplies in a duffel bag or backpack and keep it in a designated place. Your kit will also come in handy if you must take shelter in your home. This list will help ensure that your disaster supply kit includes all the essentials.</p>
