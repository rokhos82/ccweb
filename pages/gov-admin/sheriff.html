<subheader>A Word From the Sheriff</subheader>
<p>"I would like to welcome everyone to our website. Our Job at the Converse County Sheriff's Office is to serve and protect the citizens of Converse County. Simply put, we work for you. I would like to thank all of you who have used my "open door" policy and have come to talk with me in person. Please, feel free to come in and talk to me on any issue. Without a two-way dialogue, it is difficult to know what we can do to better assist you. Only with your input can I get a better feel for how we as a Sheriff's Office are serving you and where we need to concentrate more enforcement activity.</p>
<p>So please feel free to call this office at 307-358-4700 and if I am not in, leave me a message and I will always get back to you."</p>
<br />
Respectfully,<br />
Your Sheriff,<br />
<em>Clint Becker</em>

<subheader>Meet the Sheriff</subheader>
<p>Sheriff Clint Becker was elected the 21st Sheriff of Converse County in 2006. He was sworn in as Sheriff in January of 2007. Sheriff Becker values teamwork, community outreach, training and professionalism.  He relies on citizen input and community partnerships in his commitment to community-oriented policing.  He also fosters a "participatory management" philosophy, in which all his employees are given a voice in the operation of the Sheriff's Office. These beliefs and philosophies have led to him being reelected twice; in 2009 and in 2014. His third term in Office began on January 1st, 2015.</p>
<p>In 1986, Sheriff Becker moved to Converse County to start his law enforcement career with the Wyoming Highway Patrol. He served for 20 years with the Patrol, entirely in the Converse County area. Upon retiring with the Wyoming Highway Patrol, he made the decision to run for Office of Sheriff in order to continue his service to the people of Converse County.</p>
