<p>Converse County dates back to its founding in 1886 and is known for its many attractions. The location is superb for year round recreation including a free Recreation Center, hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, and rafting as well as many other activities. We have it all for you to enjoy!</p>

<p>Through the middle of Douglas flows the North Platte River which leads to the nearby Glendo Reservoir. After a dip in the river or a ski on the lake, you might want to take a hike in the Laramie Peak area. Esterbrook is a mere 28 miles from town.</p>

<p>But that is not all! We have three museums loaded with artifacts from the Oregon Trail era to when dinosaurs roamed the earth. Glenrock's Paleontological Museum offers you free admission to see Dr. Bakker's collection of Jurassic-age dinosaur bones, and even offers digs and classes!</p>

<p>Summer does not end your adventures, autumn and winter in Wyoming bring many opportunities to hunt and fish. Elk, antelope and mule deer run free in the grasslands of Converse County. Better hurry now and contact The Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Department to meet the deadlines to get ahead of hunting seasons!</p>

<p>After a tiring day, there is always a need for good grub and a warm bed. Throughout the county, you will find we offer home cookin'! The Paisley Shawl and The Morton Mansion can provide you with a personal touch in their Bed &amp; Breakfast Inns. The Broken Wheel Truck Stop prepares massive platters of true American food! There are also a wide variety in fast food chains. Places to stay include the historic LaBonte Hotel to modern motor inns.</p>

<p>Converse County has everything you desire anything from exciting adventures to a pleasant stay!</p>

                      <p class="noindent">Converse County is a hot spot for historical findings.
                        There are three amazing museums for you to explore!</p>

                      <p class="noindent"><strong>Glenrock Deer Creek Museum</strong><br>
        935 W Birch<br>
        Glenrock, WY<br>
        (307) 436-2810</p>
                      <p class="noindent"><b>Paleontological Museum</b><br>
        The Glenrock Paleontology museum is concerned with the process of cleaning,
          repairing and exhibiting fossil remains. The museum was started after
          the discovery of a Triceratops skull just outside of Glenrock in 1994.
          They offer one day excursions and week long programs allowing participants
          to help excavate and prepare fossils.</p>

                      <p class="noindent"><b>Pioneer Museum</b><br>
        The Pioneer museum is located on the Wyoming State Fair Grounds. There
          you will find many historical artifacts and an array of Native American
          Indian clothing, pottery and tools; World War I and II guns and swords,
          and even the original bar from the LaBonte Inn dating back to 1914!</p>

                        No pets are allowed in the park because of health
                        and safety issues. <br>
        Located smack dab in between Douglas and Glenrock is Ayres Natural Bridge.
        This massive 150 acre solid rock arch is a perfect peaceful place for
        picnicking.</p>
                      <p class="noindent">The Oregon Trail passed through this area, and it was
                        a haven for white settlers passing through Wyoming. Legend
                        has it that an Indian was struck by lightning and killed
                        while atop the bridge. After that, Native Americans would
                        not ever go near the bridge or its surroundings. The
                        Natural Bridge was often visited by emigrants. It was,
                        perhaps, Wyoming's first tourist attraction. An 1843
                        pioneer described it as, &quot;...a natural bridge of
                        solid rock, over a rapid torrent, the arch being regular
                        as tho' shaped by art....&quot; The stream, originally
                        known as Bridge Creek, is now called LaPrele Creek and
                        flows through a beautiful public park surrounding the
                        Bridge.</p>

                      <p class="noindent">Ayres Natural Bridge Park is located 11 miles west of
