<p>The Glenrock Fire Department consists of volunteer firefighters.  This dedicated group of citizens maintain emergency services in several areas.  They are equiped to fight structural, chemical, grass and wild fires.  But the firefighters also respond to emergency situations such as vehicular accidents on the interstate and in the county.  The Fire Department Volunteers are well educated in HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials), for weather related emergencies and carbon monoxide calls.</p>

<p>The Fire Department has two fire halls, one in downtown Glenrock and the other in Rolling Hills.  The Fire Department gets its support from both Converse County and the Town of Glenrock.</p>
