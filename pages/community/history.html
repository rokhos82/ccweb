                <p align="left"><b>General History of Converse County</b></p>
<p align="left">Converse County was established March 9, 1888.
                  It was named after Amasa R. Converse, a Wyoming pioneer and
                  Cheyenne banker. Converse County was carved from Albany and
                  Laramie Counties. On May 18, 1888 Douglas was voted the county
                  seat.</p>
                <p align="left">It was stated in the 1907 anniversary edition
                  of &quot;Bill Barlow's Budget&quot; that there was 6,624 square
                  miles of land in Converse County. The land extended a distance
                  of 170 miles east and west, and 92 miles north and south at
                  its widest parts. In 1911 Niobrara County was carved out of
                  Converse County. Presently the county covers approximately
                  4,200 square miles.</p>
