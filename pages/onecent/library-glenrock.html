			 <tr><th style="vertical-align:top;">Commentary:</th><td>After a General Contractor pre-qualification process was performed, Sampson Construction Co., Inc, of Cheyenne, Wyoming was the successful bidder for the Glenrock Branch Library Expansion Project.

<br />
The soils report identified the need for special foundation design accommodations for the Glenrock Branch Library.  As a result, it has been determined that the existing library building will be remodeled as a stand-alone community meeting venue associated with the Glenrock Branch Library.  The library proper will be constructed as a new building on the same property but separated from the existing building by approximately 30 feet.  Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the construction period have been made.</td></tr>
