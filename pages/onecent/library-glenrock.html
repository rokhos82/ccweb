<br />
The soils report identified the need for special foundation design accommodations for the Glenrock Branch Library. As a result, it has been determined that the existing library building will be remodeled as a stand-alone community meeting venue associated with the Glenrock Branch Library. The library proper will be constructed as a new building on the same property but separated from the existing building by approximately 30 feet. Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the upcoming construction period are being evaluated by the Project team.<br />
<br />
In addition, a General Contractor Pre-qualification process is underway for the Glenrock Branch Library Expansion Project. The pre-qualification process is designed to identify reputable General Contractors having experience with like-sized and designed building projects. Formal identification of the selected pre-qualified General Contractors is expected by April 2014.</td></tr>
