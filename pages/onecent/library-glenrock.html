		<p>General Contractor Sampson Construction Co., Inc, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, was the successful bidder for the Glenrock Branch Library Expansion Project.  Construction operations began on July 14, 2014.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Current building operations include building foundation construction, structural steel erection, and underground utilities installations.</p>
		<br />
		<p><i>(See "Additional Information" section under this Glenrock Branch Library heading for construction progress photographs.)</i></p>
		<br />
		<p>The soils report identified the need for special foundation design accommodations for the Glenrock Branch Library.  As a result, the existing library building will be remodeled as a stand-alone community meeting venue associated with the Glenrock Branch Library.  The library proper is being constructed as a new building on the same property but separated from the existing building by approximately 30 feet.  Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the construction period are underway.</p>
