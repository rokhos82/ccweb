			 <tr><th style="vertical-align:top;">Commentary:</th><td>Architectural design was temporarily suspended in January 2014, to address a number of special design details affecting the Douglas Main Library. Prior to suspension, approximately 80% of the architectural design had been completed. Among the new design accommodations being evaluated is an expanded Genealogy area, as well as enhanced provisions for future floor space modifications within the library building. Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the upcoming construction period are being evaluated by the Project team.</td></tr>
