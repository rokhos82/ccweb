				<p>A revised architectural design approach was approved in the summer of 2014.  Current emphasis is on preparing the detailed architectural design plans for construction bidding set to take place in March 2015.  Among the accommodations included in the revised design effort is a completely new exterior appearance, an expanded Genealogy area, as well as enhanced provisions for future floor space modifications within the library building.  The current design approach includes enlarging the library building footprint to toward the north, as well as providing additional and enhanced parking areas.</p>

				<p>A general contractor pre-qualification process is underway.  The pre-qualification process is intended to identify a set of the most highly qualified general contractors who will be allowed to bid for the construction project.</p>

				<p>Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the upcoming construction period are being made by the Converse County Library Board.</p>
