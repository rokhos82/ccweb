			 <tr><th style="vertical-align:top;">Commentary:</th><td>Architectural design was temporarily suspended in January 2014, to address a number of special design details affecting the Douglas Main Library.  Since May 2014, the revised design is underway.  Among the new accommodations included in the revised design effort is an expanded Genealogy area, as well as enhanced provisions for future floor space modifications within the library building.  The design approach includes remodeling the existing library building and constructing an attached addition space to the north, as well as providing additional and enhanced parking area.
			 <br /><br />
			 Arrangements for maintaining Library operations during the upcoming construction period are being evaluated by the Project Design Team.
