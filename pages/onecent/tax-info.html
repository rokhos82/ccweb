<p>In November 2012, the voters of Converse County elected to impose a One Percent Optional Sales Tax within the County to fund construction of three (3) specific public improvement projects to be completed in Converse County.  These three projects are identified as follows <i>(including the current estimated project costs for each facility)</i>:</p>

<ul style="font-weight:700;line-height:20pt; margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">
  <li>An enlarged Converse County Library in Douglas <i>($12,085,823)</i>;</li>
  <li>An enlarged Glenrock Branch Library <i>($5,619,530)</i>; and,</li>
  <li>A new Douglas Campus of Eastern Wyoming College <i>(originally $9,700,000; currently $10,579,735)</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Optional 1&cent; Sales Tax is designed to remain in place until the full amount of tax revenues have been collected, at which time the Optional One-Cent Sales Tax will expire.  The estimated term of the tax is four (4) years, with tax collections beginning in April 2013.  Estimated costs for the individual 1¢ Projects include construction and furnishings, architectural and engineering design, construction management, operations and maintenance, and contingency funding.  Initial plans to bond the projects have been abandoned by the County Commissioners.</p>

<p>The Converse County Commissioners are the owners of the three projects for the purposes of constructing the facilities.  In May 2013, the County Commissioners selected Inberg-Miller Engineers, from Casper, to perform Construction Management/Owner’s Representative services throughout the three construction projects.</p>

The current construction schedules for the individual 1¢ Projects are projected as follows:
