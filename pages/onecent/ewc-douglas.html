		<p>Construction operations on the EWC "Building Package" began in January 2014.  Prior to the Building Package, an “Earthwork Package” project was performed at the site.  The EWC site was found to have had significant amounts of waste concrete buried across the site.  A majority of the buried waste concrete is suspected to have originated from demolishing the World War II Prisoner-of-War Camp in Douglas.  The waste concrete stood to adversely affect the building and paved areas for the EWC development.  The Earthwork Package site preparation construction is now complete.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Current operations associated with the Building Package include interior building finishes, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system completions, exterior building finishes, and site plan improvements such as paving and irrigation system installations.</p>
		<br />
		<p><i>(See "Additional Information" section under this EWC heading for construction progress photographs.)</i></p>
		<br />
		<p>Higher than expected construction costs resulted in the need for additional project financing outlays including a combination of infusions from Converse County and EWC, as well as performing “value engineering”.  Value engineering is a collaborative process to identify cost optimization opportunities generally involving minimizing aesthetic features to achieve cost savings.</p>
