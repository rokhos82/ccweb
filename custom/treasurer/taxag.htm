<h2><b>How is Agricultural Land Valued?</b></h2>
<p>
The Wyoming Department of Revenue issues a pamphlet on the valuation of Agricultural 
property.  It is reprinted here:
<p>
<b>General Information</b>
<p>
Many states have laws regarding the preferential assessment of agricultural land. This means that
farm and ranch land is assessed based on its capability to produce agricultural products.  In
Wyoming, agricultural land is taxed based on the land's average productive capability under
normal conditions.
<p>
<b>AgLand Definitions</b>
<p>
Common questions oftentimes arise in classifying agricultural lands. Wyoming uses the following
points as guidelines:
<ol type="1">
	<li>The land must have been used or employed during the previous two years for agricultural purposes.
	<li>The land must presently be used for agricultural or horticultural production for the purpose of obtaining monetary profit.
	<li>The first two items apply unless the property is legally zoned for a different purpose.
</ol>
<b>Determining Productivity</b>
<p>
There are three required steps that must be satisfied to determine agricultural land productivity:
<ol type="1">
	<li><b>Ownership.</b> Identifying property ownership and classifying property types
	(i.e., urban, suburban, agricultural land, etc.) is the responsibility of the County
	Assessor's Office.  The proper identification of property ownership is essential to the
	agricultural land evaluation process.  It determines the ownership boundaries and is the
	beginning step in determining land use.
	<li><b>Land Use.</b> There are three major categories of agricultural land.  They are 
	irrigated, dry crop and range land.  Any, or all three, may be found in any given parcel
	of land.  To properly value each agricultural parcel, these components must be correctly
	identified.  This is accomplished through the use of various materials, including arial
	photography.
	<li><b>Productivity.</b> The following three classes of agricultural land are used in
	identifying productivity:
</ol>
<blockquote>
<b><i>Irrigated Crop Land</i></b><br>
Tons of hay per acre is the productivity measurement used for valuing irrigated crop lands.  
This "measurement" is determined by environmental factors that affect the soils' ability to
produce.  These "factors," or limitations, are published in the Federal Government's Soil
Survey and include items such as precipitation, length of growing season, slope, etc.
<p>
<b><i>Dry Crop Land</i></b><br>
Bushels of winter wheat, per acre, is the productivity measurement used for valuing dry crop
land.  As with irrigated crop land, this "measurement" is determined by environmental factors 
that affect the soils' ability to produce.  These "factors," or limitations, are identical to
those used with irrigated crop land.
<p>
<b><i>Range Land</i></b><br>
Animal Unit Months or "AUMs", is the productivity measurement used for valuing range lands.  
The term "AUM" is defined as the amount of forage required to sustain a 1,000 pound cow, 
with or without a calf, for one month.
</blockquote>
<b>Determining Value</b>
<p>
Once ownership has been identified, land use has been established and the productivity
capability has been tabulated for the parcel, a four step valuation process begins:
<ol type="1">
	<li><b>Determine Prices of Agricultural Products.</b> This information is derived from the Wyoming Agricultural Statistics Service's commodity price data.  This information, which consists of hay, wheat and grazing prices, are converted to a 5 year weighted average.
	<li><b>Capitalization Rate Selected.</b> This rate is based on the Farm Credit Services of Omaha's Long Term Portfolio rates, which is also converted to a 5 year weighted average.
	<li><b>Determine Net Income.</b> To determine the net income, the unit price of each of the 3 commodities is used.  Next, if applicable, the landlord share is determined, then the expenses and production losses are deducted.
	<li><b>Capitalize Net Income.</b> The final step in this process is capitalizing the net income.  The following formula illustrates the process:
Land Value per Acre = Yield Per Acre X Net Value Per Commodity Unit / (divided by) Capitalization Rate
</ol>
<b>Figuring the Tax Bill</b>
<p>
Wyoming is a fractional assessment state.  This means that the taxable value is based on a portion
of the full value.  In Wyoming this fractional amount is 9.5%.  To get the assessed value
multiply the value times 9.5%.
<p>
The assessed value is then multiplied by the appropriate tax district mill levy, to obtain
the tax bill.
