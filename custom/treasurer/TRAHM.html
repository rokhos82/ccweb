<p class="style4">Transportable Homes </p>
          <p>In Wyoming, a Transportable Home is defined as the following::          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>&quot;Modular home&quot; means a residential dwelling constructed in a factory to a residential construction code other than the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards.</li>
            <li>&quot;Prebuilt home&quot; means any residential dwelling that is wholly, or in substantial part, made, fabricated, formed or assembled in manufacturing facilities for installation or assembly on a building site. Prebuilt home shall include, but not be limited to, a manufactured home, modular home and mobile home. </li>
            <li>&quot;Manufactured home&quot; means a residential dwelling built in accordance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards which is a unit more than eight and one-half (8 1/2) feet in width which is designed, constructed and equipped as a dwelling place, living abode or place of business to which wheels may be attached for movement upon streets and highways except a unit used primarily as a mobile laboratory or mobile office.</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="subHeader">Moving Permits</p>
          <p class="bodyText">The Converse County Treasurer's Office requires that two criteria to be met before a moving permit is issued for a Mobile Home.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A Title</li>
            <li>The current years taxes to be paid in full</li>
            </ol>
          <p>This is from the Wyoming Statute 31-2-508 which states:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Before any transportable home or portion thereof, whose original  movement commences within the state of Wyoming is conveyed upon any  street or highway, the owner shall present a proof of ownership for each  portion of a prebuilt or modular home, or a <strong class="navText">certificate of title if for  a mobile home</strong>, to the county treasurer of the county in which the  transportable home is located, and <span class="navText"><strong>pay the current year's taxes</strong></span> as  computed by the county treasurer. In the event the ad valorem levy has  not been set for the current year, the current year's tax shall be  computed upon the levy for the previous year. Upon full payment of the  current year's taxes due, the county treasurer shall issue a receipt  describing the transportable home and indicating the current year's  taxes are paid. Upon presentation of the receipt to the director of the  department of transportation, or his authorized representative, the  owner may be issued an over-width permit.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Upon payment of the current years taxes, and once the Title has been presented, the Treasurer's Office will complete a form for  a Moving Permit. This form is then brought to the local Deparment of Transportation office for the actual permits to be placed on the Mobile Home.</p>
          <p class="subHeader">Selling - Change of Title</p>
<p class="bodyText">The State of Wyoming only requires a Sales Tax on the first selling of a new Mobile Home. As mentioned in Wyoming Statute 39-15-103:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The tax imposed by this article upon the sale of a transportable home shall be collected upon the first sale of the transportable home. The tax shall be collected on seventy percent (70%) of the sales price of the transportable home. No sales tax shall be collected upon any subsequent sale of the home.</li>
  </ul>
<p>However, the current years property taxes need to be paid in order for a title to be transfered. If the current years taxes have not been set yet, the County Assessor's Office will issue a form for taxes due. This form is then brought to the Treasurer's Office for payment. A receipt is issued which is brought to the Converse County Clerk's Office with the notorized seller's title, and a new title is issued in the buyer's name.</p>
<p class="subHeader">Property Taxes</p>
<p class="bodyText">Transportable Homes are classified as personal property. If they are on a piece of land, they will be taxed seperate, since the land is classified as real property.</p>
<p class="bodyText">If a Transportable Home is placed on a permanent foundation, then the title to the home is turned into the Court House, and a deed is issued when all current years taxes have been paid.  At that time, it is classified as real property, and is taxed together with the land.</p>
