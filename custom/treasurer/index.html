          <p class="bodyText">It can be as basic as finding out what the County's total revenue is, and can be as intricate as finding out what each specific Department spends on office supplies.</p>

          <p class="subHeader">NEW STATE FEES FOR HT PLATES - CAMPERS</p>
          <p>As of January 1, 2015, there will be changes regarding the state fees on all new and current travel trailer plates registered in Wyoming.</p>
          <p>Presently, the state fee on all travel trailers is $15.00. At the beginning of the year, the state fee amount will vary depending on the weight of the travel trailer, just like all other types of trailers that are currently registered in Wyoming. Any new or current travel trailers registered or renewed before December 31st, 2014, will still have the $15.00 state fee.</p>
          <p>If you currently have a travel trailer licensed, after the 1st of the year the fees may change at the time of renewal, depending on the weight. You can find a <a href="House Trailer Fees.pdf" target="_blank">guideline here </a>that talkes about the weight classes.</p>
          <p>If you feel that your trailer doesn&rsquo;t fit into the guidelines, please feel free to have your trailer weighed at any local weighing station and present us with the weight slip.          </p>
          <p class="subHeader">I HAVE MORTGAGE, WHY DID I GET A TAX BILL?</p>
          <p><span data-ft="{'tn':'K'}">Now  that the 2014 tax notices are hitting mailboxes, a common question is:   If my mortgage company pays my taxes, what should I do with the tax  bill? <br />
            <br />
            We suggest you just keep it for your records.  It's not  necessary to forward it to your mortgage company, unless they have  requested that you do so, as we send records to mortgage companies  electronically for tax payments.  All property owners will receive tax  bills, even if their taxes are escrowed and paid by their mortgage  companies.</span></p>
          <p class="subHeader">2014 TAXES - WHY DO TAXES GO UP?</p>
          <p>As we get ready for the 2014 Taxes to be mailed out the first week of September, the Treasurer wanted to talk a little about one of our most common questions asked.</p>
          <p><em>Why did my taxes go up?</em>.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">You can check out our write-up on the <a href="http://conversecounty.org/gov-admin/treasurer/taxes.html" target="_blank">property tax page</a>.          </p>
