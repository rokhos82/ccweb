          <p class="subHeader">I HAVE MORTGAGE, WHY DID I GET A TAX BILL?</p>
          <p><span data-ft="{'tn':'K'}">Now  that the 2013 tax notices are hitting mailboxes, a common question is:   If my mortgage company pays my taxes, what should I do with the tax  bill? <br />
              <br />
We suggest you just keep it for your records.  It's not  necessary to forward it to your mortgage company, unless they have  requested that you do so, as we send records to mortgage companies  electronically for tax payments.  All property owners will receive tax  bills, even if their taxes are escrowed and paid by their mortgage  companies.</span></p>
